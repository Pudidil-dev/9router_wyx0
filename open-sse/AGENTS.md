# Provider Runtime Core

## Purpose

- Own the provider-neutral streaming engine that converts OpenAI-style requests into provider calls for chat, image, embedding, TTS, STT, search, and fetch workflows.

## Ownership

- `handlers/` owns modality-specific request cores and provider handlers.
- `services/` owns model resolution, token refresh, usage, combos, and account fallback.
- `executors/` owns upstream provider calls; `base.js` defines `BaseExecutor` and `index.js` selects provider executors.
- `providers/` owns provider registry construction, capabilities, pricing, and generated registry imports.
- `config/` owns provider definitions, model metadata, runtime limits, and other constants.
- `translator/` owns request and response format conversion under its nested contract.
- `utils/`, `shared/`, `rtk/`, and `transformer/` own shared streaming and provider-runtime helpers.

## Local Contracts

- Preserve the chat lifecycle: `handlers/chatCore.js` resolves the model, selects an executor, translates the request, streams the upstream response, and translates chunks into the client format.
- Keep models, provider metadata, role and block strings, limits, and other stable values config-driven rather than hard-coded in execution paths.
- Keep warning and default-active metadata separate from `systemDisabled`; warned providers may remain user-enableable unless a hard runtime lock is intentional.
- Keep CodeBuddy global user-enableable while surfacing upstream rejection warnings; only reintroduce `systemDisabled` for a verified hard runtime lock.
- Use OpenAI as the normal intermediate translator format, but prefer an exact source-to-target registration when the bridge would lose thinking, images, tool identifiers, error state, or wire-format details.
- Keep binary AWS EventStream, protobuf ConnectRPC, and NDJSON handling in their specialized executors instead of treating them as ordinary JSON or SSE translators.
- Preserve abort propagation, streaming order, fallback behavior, terminal errors, and usage accounting across provider paths.
- Keep provider registry `features.usage` and `features.usageApikey` aligned with implemented usage handlers so dashboard/API eligibility matches runtime support.
- Provider-specific usage handlers may return durable metadata patches, but credit refreshes must not overwrite authentication, activation, or gateway-state metadata owned by the provider lifecycle.
- Treat `providers/registry/index.js` as generated output; regenerate it after adding or removing registry modules.

## Work Guidance

- Add a provider by copying `providers/REGISTRY_TEMPLATE.js` to `providers/registry/<id>.js` and adding its models to `config/providerModels.js`.
- Add a custom executor only for non-standard upstream behavior; otherwise rely on `DefaultExecutor`.
- Add translators through the existing registration pattern, import registration modules from `translator/index.js`, and reuse translator schema and concern helpers.
- Trace both request and response paths before changing format conversion, fallback, or stream handling.

## Verification

- Run focused executor, routing, fallback, and provider tests under `tests/unit`.
- Run the relevant translator tests under `tests/translator` with `--config tests/vitest.config.js` when formats or model metadata change.
- Run `tests/translator/coverage-all-models.test.js` after provider registry or model-matrix changes.
- Run `npm run build` when exports, configuration, or server bundling changes.
